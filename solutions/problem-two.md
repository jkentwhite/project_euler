# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution:

```function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let sum = 0, prevnum = 1, nextnum = 2;
  while(nextnum <= n){

    if(nextnum%2 === 0){
      sum += nextnum;
    }

    nextnum = prevnum + nextnum;
    prevnum = nextnum - prevnum;
  }

  return sum;
}
```
